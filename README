Takes a string input and converts the string into the HID equivalent.  Similar
to an ASCII representation of a string, this is the HID keyboard equivalent as 
defined in the USB 1.1 specification.  

Handy utility if you are doing any virtual keyboard type design and would like
to send back a string to the host.
